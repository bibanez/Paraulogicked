# Paraulogicked
This is a simple project for solving the game Paraul√≤gic, popular where I'm from.

## Usage

In your terminal (assuming bash):
```
chmod +x solver.x
```
```
./solver.x
```
Then input 7 letters, starting with the central character.

An explanation for this project can be found [here](https://bibanez.github.io/dictionaries-paraulogic/).
